# Europe Travel App

Built using R Shiny, the app aims to provide convenience in travel planning to potential and existing travelers visiting countries in Europe. Users are able to browse through multiple tabs with the input interface, allowing them to choose their destination of interest along with other specifications. The “dashboards” easily summarise key information and statistics of concern from various sources, which would enable users to make informed decision based on their interest, choices and preferences. 

The following are information that can be obtained from the various tabs in the app: 
* Travel Map
* Covid-19 Stats
* Weather
* Tourist Nights
* Restuarants
* Luxurious Hotels
